# MacGyver Game

## **Game Rules**
For this game, you'll have to escape from the labyrinth.  
But in order to do so, you'll have to send the guardian off to sleep.  
You'll need to collect 3 items for this. An item counter is displayed on the bottom left corner.  
Once you have collected all 3 items, you can make the guardian sleep and escape.

## **How to make the game work**
1. Python must be installed on your computer
2. You have to create a virtual environment
3. Pygame dependency need to be installed as well
    
For the virtual environment you need to create it:
* Windows: `py -3.8 -m venv env`
* Mac/Linux: `python3 -m venv env`
    
Then activate it: 
* Windows: `source venv\Scripts\activate`
* Mac/Linux: `source/bin/activate`

Regarding the Pygame dependency: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can launch the game:
* Windows: `python main.py`
